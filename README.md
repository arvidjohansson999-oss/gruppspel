This is a thing I made to work with a hosting platform like render or railway. I am currently using it to play amongus irl, hehe silly me. 
idk u can use it is u want but if ur here ur probobly a person who understands code better then I do anyways and can make this 100x better with half the effort.
The text is in Swedish so gl reading it. Underneath is all the roles that are in this random role picker. you can make up you own rules of how the diffrent characters will be played.

heres the roles:
bomb = bomb = impostor
Förädare = impostor = impostor
Dödskalle = dead skull = impostor
Avrättare = executioner = not impostor and not crewmate, it's on it's own
Trogen = innocent = crewmate
Sheriff = sheriff = crewmate


To use it when it's all set up on your web or local lan you can enter your name and a lobby code (main is the defult) which other players can also enter. When all your desierd players are in the lobby you just press the fancy
little button to start the game and everyone instantly get their roles. The impostors get their teammates names on a list. The executioner gets the name of the person they are set to eliminate in voting.
